# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION
### Abstraction:
   - The stock market is where investors buy and sell shares of companies. It's a set of exchanges where companies issue shares and other securities for trading. It also includes over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces where investors trade securities directly with each other (rather than through an exchange.
    -  A stock market, also known as a stock exchange, is a venue to trade securities, such as  bonds and shares. Sellers of securities are matched with their buyers in a stock market and they trade with each other using rules imposed by the market's governing authority.
     - We use candles only because the body of the candle represents the opening and closing price of the trading done during the period. Knowing this is important for candlestick trading. Hence, traders can see the price range of the said stock for the said period at a glance.
-	We use charts because besides allowing the technical analyst to easily spot patterns and trends, the main benefits of charts are the concise presentation of price and volume information over a duration, which can be used by fundamentalists to study how the market has reacted to specific events.
-	There are thousands of companies listed on a stock market and each company undergoes multiple price gyrations in a day. Therefore, it is impossible to gauge the market's broad movements by tracking individual stocks.
